# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

All my Tailwind CSS Sharing with project..
# 🌟 **Happy to share my project!**

I built a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** with smooth **custom animations**, **AOS Library**, and **Swiper.js**. The full website flow, logic building, and core concepts are successfully completed! 💻✨

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed this self-taught project using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS animations**, and other useful libraries. 🎯

### 📚 Libraries Used
---

✅ React Icons — [https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
✅ AOS Animation — [https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
✅ Swiper.js — [https://swiperjs.com/](https://swiperjs.com/)

### 🧠 About the Project
---

This project helped me deepen my understanding of key **React.js concepts** and how the **Document Object Model (DOM)** works. I learned how JavaScript logic controls animations, how to use the **map() function** for dynamic cards, and how Tailwind CSS helps in building smooth animations.

I also improved my problem-solving skills by handling UI updates, animation timing, and efficient rendering using React’s component structure.



---
### 💻 Technologies Used
---

✅ React — Custom logic with `map()` for dynamic testimonial cards
✅ Virtual DOM manipulation with dynamic animation handling
✅ Event listeners — onScroll with ternary operator logic
✅ Dynamic UI updates using arrays and animation flows

In this task, I focused on building core component logic and understanding how React works internally.
